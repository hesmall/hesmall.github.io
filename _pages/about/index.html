Broadly, I am interested in how the brain spatially organizes information across the hemispheres, why this neural architecture works, and how this can inspire better AI systems. Currently, I use fMRI and deep neural networks to study this in the context of multimodal social processing of naturalistic stimuli.</p> <p>I earned my B.S. from University of Richmond where I studied biology and computer science and worked in an ion channel electrophysiology lab. Before graduate school, I worked as a technical associate in Ev Fedorenko’s lab at MIT, studying how the brain processes language.</p> <p>Outside of research, I like to throw pots, read books, and learn new things.</p> </body></html>
