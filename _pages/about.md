I'm a 4th year computational cognitive science PhD student advised by Leyla Isik at Johns Hopkins University. 
Broadly, I am interested in how the brain spatially organizes information across the hemispheres, why this neural architecture works, and how this can inspire better AI systems. Currently, I use fMRI and deep neural networks to study this in the context of multimodal social processing of naturalistic stimuli. 

I earned my B.S. from University of Richmond where I studied biology and computer science and worked in an ion channel electrophysiology lab. Before graduate school, I worked as a technical associate in Ev Fedorenko's lab at MIT, studying how the brain processes language.

Outside of research, I like to throw pots, read books, and learn new things.
