I'm a 4th year computational cognitive science PhD student advised by Leyla Isik at Johns Hopkins University. 
I am interested in how humans process the complex world of social interactions, especially how the brain spatially organizes the relevant systems and why this neural architecture works. Currently, I use fMRI and deep neural networks to study this in the context of multimodal social processing of naturalistic stimuli. 

I earned my B.S. from University of Richmond where I studied biology and computer science and investigated how potassium ion channels modulated action potentials. Before graduate school, I worked in Ev Fedorenko's lab at MIT, studying how the brain processes language.

Outside of research, I like to throw pots, read books, and learn new things.
