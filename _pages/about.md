I'm a 4th year computational cognitive science PhD student advised by Leyla Isik at Johns Hopkins University. 
Broadly, I am interested in how humans process the world of social interactions in which we are immersed. What are the computations necessary for extracting social information from the variety of signals from the world around us? How are these computations implemented in the human brain? I am interested in how the brain spatially organizes these processes across the hemispheres, why this neural architecture works, and how this can inspire better AI systems. Currently, I use fMRI and deep neural networks to study this in the context of multimodal social processing of naturalistic stimuli. 

I earned my B.S. from University of Richmond where I studied biology and computer science and investigated how potassium ion channels modulated action potentials. Before graduate school, I worked in Ev Fedorenko's lab at MIT, studying how the brain processes language.

Outside of research, I like to throw pots, read books, and learn new things.
